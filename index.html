                I am currently studying at the University of Idaho as an 
                Economics major and Computer Science minor. I have some 
                interest in building websites. I am seeking to work in a 
                business or marketing role that favors basic website-building
                know-how, or possibly in a web-development role. Contact me at
                nelsonlylev@gmail.com.

                    This is a simple diamond collecting game, built with C++. You play as an Indiana Jones character and 
                    there are hidden diamonds at random locations on the screen. The goal is to collect
                    as many diamonds as you can. You can set a timer for it if you want.

                        This is a project built in LC-3 that has an animation of a fish moving across the screen 
                        and blowing bubbles.

                    In this game, you mine the moon for cheese simply by clicking on the moon image with your mouse.
                    The store on the left allows you to buy items that dig at a faster rate in exchange for a certain
                    amount of cheese. This game was built with HTML JS and CSS.
